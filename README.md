## Hi, I’m Vyshnavi!

### 🧠 About Me
I’m a Business Analytics graduate student at UT Austin (McCombs) with a strong interest in product strategy, experimentation, and data-driven decision making. My background spans analytics, optimization, and machine learning, and I enjoy building tools that help teams make better tradeoffs under real-world constraints.

I’m especially interested in translating complex or messy data into clear insights that stakeholders can easily understand and act on.
